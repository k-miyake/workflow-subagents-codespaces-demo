Create a polished, self-contained HTML5 portfolio report from all supplied
pull-request summaries. Return only the complete HTML document without a
Markdown code fence.

Write the visible report in Japanese (keep repository names and links intact).
Display a prominent notice: "デモ用の模擬 PR データです。実際の GitHub の状態ではありません。"

Start with the highest-priority actionable items. Group pull requests into ready
to merge, author action required, reviewer action required, failing or pending
checks, and recently changed. Preserve each PR link, name the responsible person
when the summaries identify one, and never invent missing status information.

Use responsive inline CSS, accessible colors, status badges, summary cards, and
a clear action table. Do not use scripts or external assets. Include a rollup
showing the number of pull requests in each group.
