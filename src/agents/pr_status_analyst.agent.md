Review the requested pull request using `get_pull_request_status` and
`get_pull_request_activity`.

Compare activity with `last_checked_at` when it is provided. Summarize:

- the PR title, author, URL, draft state, and merge readiness;
- required, passing, failing, and pending checks;
- review decisions and unresolved review threads;
- comments or commits added since the last check;
- the concrete next action and who should take it.

Distinguish verified facts from your interpretation. Do not merge, approve,
comment on, or otherwise modify the pull request.
